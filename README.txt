Course contents block
*********************

The Course Contacts block displays a list of users on your course and various 
methods for communicating with them.

The block is highly customisable and allows you to choose specific roles which
you wish to display users from. By default the block will show teachers on the
course but this can be changed however you wish.

You can also configure which communication types you wish to show, the block 
can provide quick links to Email, Message or Telephone each user.

The block also shows whether the user has been active in the last five minutes.
